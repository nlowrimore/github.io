                <h1>Best Snow on Earth</h1>
                <p>With an average of 500 annual inches of Utah dry, powder snow, you can be assured you will find great snow conditions on some of the most challenging slopes in the world at our 14 ski areas. Whether you like deep fluffy powder or nicely groomed slopes, Utah has it. The majority of the resorts are located within one hour of the Salt Lake City International Airport. Brian Head, in Southern Utah, is just 2.5 hours from Las Vegas. You can arrive in the morning and ski the afternoon. Most resorts have ski-in, ski-out accommodations so you can make best use of your vacation time. Stay at one resort (with ski-in, ski-out you never have to leave), or resort hop and ski several in one trip.
                </p>
                <h2>Park City</h2>
                <p>Park City Mountain Resort is a ski resort in the western United States in Park City, Utah, located 32 miles (51 km) east of Salt Lake City. Park City, as the ski resort and area is known, contains several training courses for the U.S. Ski Team, including slalom and giant slalom runs. During the 2002 Winter Olympics the resort hosted the snowboarding events and the men's and women's alpine giant slalom events. Opened in 1963, the resort has been a major tourist attraction for skiers from all over the United States, as well as a main employer for many of Park City's citizens. The resort was purchased by Vail Resorts in 2014 and combined the resort with neighboring Canyons Resort via an interconnect gondola to create the largest lift-served ski resort in the United States. During the ski season, most slopes and lifts are open from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m</p>
