            State Website Review Ranked

            <p>1. Minnesota:  Minnesota's site is my favorite of the options.  It is filled with color and photos and provides more information on its front page than Massachusetts. While also providing a search bar as the main item you see when you first visit the page, a search bar remains along with the navigation as the user scrolls.  It adjusts to screen size and is easy to navigate. 
            <p>2. Massachusetts:  This website has a nice design with a lot of photos and images with new an relevant information.  They too also have a search bar as the firs thing you see when you arrive at the site.  The navigation bar stays with the user as they scroll down the page, without taking up too much of the page.  This is a very helpful design.
            </p>
            <p>3. Alabama:  Alabama's website offers a more interesting design than Alaska or New Hampshire.  It has a more interesting font and offers photos and picture with information when you select them.  I also like the very large search bar with popular search terms listed underneath.
            </p>
            <p>4. New Hampshire:  The website has a a more interesting design than Alaska but still leaves some to be desired.  It also doesn't format when used on different screen sizes which can frustrating.  I like that the search bar is located at the center of the screen towards the top, because when most people visit a government site they have a specific question in mind.
            </p>
            <p>5. Alaska: The website for Alaska has a decent color scheme with navy blue being the overfall tone. It has a lot of white space with isn't as appealing to the eye. The font is also very basic which isn't necessarily bad for a governmental site, but could be more interesting. The site doesn't adjust to size of the screen which would make it hard to navigate on a phone. The navigation isn't difficult but overall with the design and inability to adjust to different sizes makes this website my least favorite
