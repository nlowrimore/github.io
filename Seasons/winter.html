                Winter starts on the shortest day of the year. Depending on where you live, this is generally around this 21 December. The weather is usually colder in some places there is lots of snow. Plants and trees stop growing. Some animals, like bats and bears one places to hide and sleep. We call this hibernation. About 10 percent of the species in the world hibernate. Winter temperatures in countries like Norway are usually cold enough to make it feel -30 °C (-32 °F) at night. The northern hemisphere of the Earth is closest to the Sun during winter. In the northern hemisphere, the winter solstice marks the point where the sun reaches its greatest elevation in the sky (the north pole). The sun doesn’t actually set in the north, because as we head north towards the equator, the Sun moves in a counter-clockwise direction. Unlike the other two points on the planet where summer comes to an end, the northern hemisphere’s winter solstice marks the end of the summer season. This happens at roughly the same time every year, and both happen around the middle of August.
