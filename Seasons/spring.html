                Spring starts when the day and night at the same length. The weather is warmer and sunnier, and trees and plants begin to grow. Many animals have their babies in spring. In rural areas, spring can be translated as “good weather”. In some northern regions, spring can be translated as “spring sun”. In most parts of the Middle East, spring refers to the phenomenon of extended sunshine during spring and summer, especially in mountainous regions. Some scientists and chemists insist on the continuous (multi-year) weather patterns that prevail during winter and spring. Others argue that the term “spring” refers to the perceived temperature changes that occur every year.
