                Autumn (is also known as the fall,) begins when the day and night are the same lengths again. During autumn, leaves change color and fall from the trees. Some animals collect food for winter comes. An albatross and seabirds make their annual migration to cooler, more temperate waters. Albatrosses fly around on the oceans in search of food. Birds of prey, such as the eagles and hawks, and raptors, such as hawks and owls, are great divers, diving for small fish or shellfish from shallow waters. Autumn marks the transition from summer to winter. In the Northern Hemisphere, this transition comes about in September, around the first week in September. In the Southern Hemisphere, it occurs sometime in March, around the first week in March
