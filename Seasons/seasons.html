                The year of the Earth is divided into four seasons. There are four seasons in a year, which are summer, autumn, winter, and spring. The seasons cause significant changes in the weather and our environment. The summer is hot and the winter is cold. Leaves change their color to pale yellow in the autumn. Seasons also change the lifestyle of human and animals. For example, we cover our bodies with jackets and coats. While we used to wear thin fabric clothes in summer.
