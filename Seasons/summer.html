                Summer generally starts on the longest day of the year. Depending on where you live, this is typically around 21 June. Summer is the warmest and sunniest time of the year. We start to see fruit grows on trees, and plants begin to flourish. Young animals become bigger and stronger. Animals have to seek out the food sources that have been ready to spoil over winter. If we only look at this period in the previous yearâ€™s calendar, we would see that the summer has a lot in common with our winter months. The same animals are beginning to hunt, kill, and survive the months of winter. In the early months of summer, we start to see some of the earliest flower blooms. Bees and butterflies are also very active at this time. You can tell what is to come in the months of July and August. Two of the earliest events take place in August. The first of these is a migration of whales and dolphins after they return from the Southern Ocean to the waters around Antarctica. The next is an explosion of wildflowers.
